### About me
// Learning front-end framworks and tools. Acquaring deep knowledge of Python ([from D.Malan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malan/)) and as well as algorithms and data structures.

I currently work as a front-end mentor assistant in Najot ta'lim (one of the popular IT school in Uzbekistan). //



### Objective 
Already set a challenging goal by planning to get offer in one of the faang companies in 5 years. So that, I can not stop putting in hard work for the upcoming years till my goal is achieved. I believe, besides hard work, being in the same team with experienced software engineers and learning from them will be a great boost.
